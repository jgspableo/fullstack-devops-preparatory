The repository documents my hands-on progress through various professional certificates. Currently, the codebase focuses on engineering fundamentals, including Linux shell scripting (Bash), Python automation, and responsive web development with JavaScript. I will integrate modules on containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-native architecture. This repository serves as a living portfolio of my technical growth from core scripting to mastering the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) into DevOps practices.
I am also working on a full-stack web app with DevOps principles and security in mind (see MAIN_PROJECTS). Current projects include:
- MOVIE_APP: An application built from a YT course that uses React, Tailwind, and Appwrite. Planning to fully utilize MERN stack with containerization, CI/CD pipelines through GitHub Actions, and expand app features such as online deployment, user accounts, etc.
